## goals: 
- the first goal of this trial is to establish linkages between color score, PAM fluorescence, and autofluoresence detected by the probe 
- additionally, we are working to establish a protocol for *P. acuta* flow cytometry by quantitatively assessing cell density via the AOPI staining protocol for apotosis and necrosis after a 24 hour incubation in either  XX% hyrdrogen peroxide 

## protocol
1. Lauren selected n=4 coral colonies of varying sizes from Hannah's corals in blue tank 2 in the CBLS aquarium. These corals are pale in color with assumed low symbiont density. n=1 coral were selected from the "unfed" treatment group from Molly's corals in blue tank one. These corals are healthy but are smaller and have less visible tissue color thank corals that experienced targeted feeding with Coral Max and Reefroids. Two small clips and 2 larger clips were cut from a single colony (four total). n=1 coral were selected from the "coral max" treatment group from Molly's corals in blue tank one. Accordingly, four total clips of similar respective sizes to the "unfed" corals were clipped. 


2. Following the [Bleaching Score protocol](https://github.com/hputnam/Coral_CNT/blob/main/Protocols/bleaching-score-protocol.md), color score photos were taken by Lauren in small jars with egg crate taped with RGB electrical tape. Lauren also measured the length of each coral using a ruler.

3. Following the [Probe SOP protocol](https://github.com/hputnam/Coral_CNT/blob/main/Protocols/Probe%20SOP.md) Sophie took autofluorescent measurements. 

4. Fragments were incubated for 24 hours at 26Â°C in either artificial sea water or XX% hydrogen peroxide.

5. On 20220727, Lauren and Sophie followed the AOPI staining protocol. 
Coral cells were harvested with mechanical scraping by a toothbrush into Petri dishes filled with 1mL PBS.

6. Coral cells with symbionts/symbionts were pelleted out via centrifugation before completing the staining protocol.
    * LZ will update with notes on centrifuging to separate coral cell types and will write protocol 

7. Sophie trained Lauren on the [Nexcelom Cellometer](https://github.com/hputnam/Coral_CNT/blob/main/Protocols/Nexcelom%20Cellometer%20protocol.md)
