## date(s): 20220727-20220728

### contributors: Lauren Zane (laurenzane@uri.edu); Sophie Lucente (sophie_lucente@uri.edu)


## goals: 
- the goal of this trial is to establish cell sorting and staining protocols 
- 

## protocol
1. On 20220727, Lauren selected n=2 coral colonies (ID = 29, 30) from the CBLS Aquarium and transported them to the Roxbury Lab in small glass jars. 


2. Four fragments (two large, two small) were incubated for 24 hours at 26Â°C in either artificial sea water (n=4) or 2 uM hydrogen peroxide (n=4).

3. On 20220728, Lauren and Sophie will follow the Annexin V staining protocol. 

4. Coral cells will be harvested with mechanical scraping by a toothbrush into Petri dishes filled with 1mL PBS.

5. Coral cells with symbionts/symbionts will be pelleted out via centrifugation for 5 minutes at 100 RCF.

6. Sophie and Lauren will follow the Annexin V manufacturers staining protocol.

7. Sophie will train Lauren on the [Nexcelom Cellometer](https://github.com/hputnam/Coral_CNT/blob/main/Protocols/Nexcelom%20Cellometer%20protocol.md)
