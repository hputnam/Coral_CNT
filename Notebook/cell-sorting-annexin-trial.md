## goals: 
- the goal of this trial is to establish cell sorting and staining protocols with Annexin V

## protocol
1. On 20220727, Lauren selected n=2 coral colonies (ID = 29, 30) from the CBLS Aquarium and transported them to the Roxbury Lab in small glass jars. 


2. Four fragments (two large, two small) were incubated for 24 hours at 26Â°C in either artificial sea water (n=4) or 2 uM hydrogen peroxide (n=4) in 2 mL of solution in a 24-well plate. Fragments from Coral ID 29 were used for control samples in ASW while Coral ID 30 fragments were treated with 2mM H2O2. 

Note: this is confounding using one fragment per treatment; clarify colony versus fragment 

3. On 20220728, corals in artificial seawater still had polyps out while corals incubated in hydrogen peroxide had visible tissue loss and tissue pooling in the well. The wells also appeared to have parts of the coral skeleton on the bottom of the well. 

Note: use a new bottle of artificial seawater from the salt mixing tank, report temp, pH and salinity, and 0.2 micron filter and put into a carboy or a shot bottle. Add pictures and a size scale with a ruler.

4. Coral cells were harvested from the corals incubated with seawater by mechanical scraping with a toothbrush. Cells were scraped into Petri dishes filled with 2mL PBS and then transfered into a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube. Coral cells from corals incubated with H2O2 were pipetted from wells as most of the tissue had sloughed off into the well. 

Note: use filtered artifical seawater and 0.2 micron filtered seawater. 


5. H2O2 treated coral cells were centrifuged at 3000rpm for 3 minutes and resuspended in 1mL PBS.

6. Coral cells with symbionts/symbionts from both treatments were be pelleted out via centrifugation for 10 minutes at 100 RCF.

Note: optimize the protocol for cell separation try 1, 3, 5, 10 min. Also try Annexin V staining with the holobiont. 

7. Coral cells in the supernatant were then transferred to a new, clean Eppendorf tube.

8. Sophie used the Nexcelom Cellometer to record the cell density. The cell density for a 1.5 cm x width fragment was about 2.73 x 10^6 cells per mL, which is about the cell density required for the Annexin V staining protocol.

Note: also try toothbrush into a bag if you're losing a lot of cells 

9. Sophie and Lauren followed the Annexin V manufacturers staining protocol for all 1.5cm long fragments, but we were unable to see the Annexin stain for apotosis and did not continue imaging for the remainder of the samples.

Notes: record catolog number and lot number and company (Invitrogen)

10. While we were unsuccessful in staining cells with Annexin V, we determined that a 1.5 cm long fragment is necessary for the cell density needed for the Annexin V staining protocol. The week of 20220801, Sophie and I will experiment with using the AOPI and Trypan blue stains as well as generate data for the color, PAM, and probe trial.

Note: add justification for each step of the experiment so that you can returrn to the notes for writing the paper. 

2200rpm for 5 minutes with multiple repeats; 2x with multiple speeds
