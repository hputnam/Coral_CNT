# Coral CNT mini trial

## investigators:
* Lauren Zane (Putnam Lab; laurenzane@uri.edu)
* Sophie Lucente (Roxbury Lab; sophie_lucente@uri.edu)

On Thursday, July 14, Sophie and I followed the [Concentration and Timepoint Optimization Protocol](https://github.com/hputnam/Coral_CNT/blob/main/Protocols/CNT-exposure-overview.md) with n=1 coral microfragments to determine timeframes for each aspect of the protocol.

## deviations from initial protocol
* incubated 32 total microfragments
  * 16 clips were frozen at -80Â°C for traditional lipidomic analysis
  * 16 clips were preserved in 20% Zfix solution for histology
* incubated 2 microfragments per well in a 24-well plate
  * observations: I expected the coral polyps to be fully retracted for the duration of the experiment due to low volume and no water flow, and CNT aggregation. In contrast, coral polyps were extended for nearly all time points.
* used 5 mg/L GL6 solution rather than 10 mg/L due to limitations in concentration in GL6 solution preparation
  * observations: CNTs visibly aggregated at 5 mg/L, but coral polyps remained extended
* could not use Roxbury compound microscope for cell counting due to inverted microscope

## challenges
  * Trypan blue staining is the most time intensive aspect of the protocol. Though we were unable to complete the protocol during this trial run, to prepare and count 4 samples, I estimate it would take about 30 minutes. The 15 and 30 minute timepoints felt rushed and we would not realistically be able to complete both of these trials with just two people
  * ring light falls when imaging; photos appear dark
