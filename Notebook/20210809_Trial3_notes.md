# Coral CNT Trial 3 (20210809)

# Setup overview
### Experimental design
- Placed 6 *Pocillopora acuta* corals, 3 treatment (1-3) and 3 control (c1-c3), into individual 100 mL glass jars with ~27 degree C .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater.

### Exposure (Day 0: 20210809)
- Cut frags to approximately 1x1 inches
- Pointed laser at whole frags, because their polyps are way too small to focus on.
- Added CNT lipid sensor mixed with filtered seawater at 5 mg/L to corals 1-3 in individual wells in a 24 well plate, at ~12:45pm. Corals c1-c3 were exposed to ~1 mL filtered seawater with no CNTs for 30 minutes and were kept as controls.
- We also exposed an aposymbiotic *Astrangia* colony (Coral 11) to 5 mg/L CNTs in a 100 mL beaker, in order to cut off 1 whole polyp, homogenize it, and look at it under the microscope to minimize algal autofluorescence interference.
- During the exposure period the plate and beaker were put in the incubator. All corals were rinsed with filtered seawater in new wells in the plate afterwards.
- Placed corals into the 27Â°C incubator (changed since *Astrangia* experiments since the *P. acuta* are coming from warmer water in water table 1).

### Measurements
- Sacrifice and image 1 coral's tissue a day on days 2, 3, and 4.
- When one polyp from the *Astrangia* comes out far enough to clip it, we will clip it, grind it up, and image it under the microscope.

# Day 1:
- Measurements at ~1 pm and Corals 1 and c1 were sacrificed to make tissue slurry.
- Use airbrush to make slurry (find the protocol/video [here](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral_Tissue_Removal_protocol/) and bring slurry in 1.5 mL tubes to engineering and pipette on slide. Used DI water while airbrushing instead of filtered seawater.
- MG used a longer exposure time under the microscope to get rid of the autofluorescence.
- *Astrangia* in incubator wasn't clipped because its polyps weren't out.

# Day 2:
- Corals 2 and c2 were sacrificed to make slurry at __, after signals were taken.

# Day 3:
- Measured signal with laser probe around __.
- Corals __ were cut in half, and the halves with polyps 1-3 and 1 respectively were sacrificed to make tissue slurry at __.

# Possible problems


# Outcomes

On day 1 (24hrs post-exposure) under the microscope we found that the *Pocillopora* tissue did uptake CNTs!!

There did seem to be less autofluorescence.

# Next steps

DR suggested blasting a coral frag with the laser for 20 minutes to bleach the chlorophyll and minimize autofluorescence, to only look at CNTs. MG may try this Thursday (day 3).

HP suggested using *Aiptasia* larvae to study uptake without interference.
