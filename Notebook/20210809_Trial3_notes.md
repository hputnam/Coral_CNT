# Coral CNT Trial 3 (20210809)

# Setup overview
### Experimental design
- Placed 6 *Pocillopora acuta* corals, 3 treatment and 3 control, into individual 100 mL glass jars with ~27 degree C .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater.

### Exposure (Day 0: 20210809)
- Cut frags to approximately ____ inches????
- Picked 3 polyps to track in treatment frags, and 1 in each control.
- Added CNT lipid sensor at 5mg/L in ~ ___ mL filtered seawater for Corals 11-13 at 12:45pm. Corals 14-16 were exposed to ~ __ mL filtered seawater with no CNTs for 30 minutes and were kept as controls.
- Placed corals into the 27Â°C incubator.

### Measurements
- We followed and measured the same distinct polyps in this experiment. We should find a good way to normalize this (or could use multiple locations and average the signals for one organism).
- Sacrifice and image 1 coral's tissue a day on days 2, 3, and 4.

# Day 1:
- Use airbrush to make slurry (find the protocol/video [here](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral_Tissue_Removal_protocol/) and bring slurry tubes over and pipette on slide in engineering.
- Measurements at __ pm and corals __ were sacrificed to make tissue slurry.

# Day 2:
- Corals __ were sacrificed to make slurry at __, after signals were taken.
- MG has data/figs.

# Day 3:
- Measured signal with laser probe around __.
- Corals __ were cut in half, and the halves with polyps 1-3 and 1 respectively were sacrificed to make tissue slurry at __.
