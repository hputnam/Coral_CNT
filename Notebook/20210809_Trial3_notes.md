# Coral CNT Trial 3 (20210809)

# Setup overview
### Experimental design
- Placed 6 *Pocillopora acuta* corals, 3 treatment (1-3) and 3 control (c1-c3), into individual 100 mL glass jars with ~27 degree C .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater.

### Exposure (Day 0: 20210809)
- Cut frags to approximately 1x1 inches
- Pointed laser at whole frags, because their polyps are way too small to focus on.
- Added CNT lipid sensor mixed with filtered seawater at 5 mg/L to corals 1-3 in individual wells in a 24 well plate, at ~12:45pm. Corals c1-c3 were exposed to ~1 mL filtered seawater with no CNTs for 30 minutes and were kept as controls.
- We also exposed an aposymbiotic *Astrangia* colony (Coral 11) to 5 mg/L CNTs in a 100 mL beaker, in order to cut off 1 whole polyp, homogenize it, and look at it under the microscope to minimize algal autofluorescence interference.
- During the exposure period the plate and beaker were put in the incubator. All corals were rinsed with filtered seawater in new wells in the plate afterwards.
- Placed corals into the 27Â°C incubator (changed since *Astrangia* experiments since the *P. acuta* are coming from warmer water in water table 1).

### Measurements
- Sacrifice and image 1 coral's tissue a day on days 2, 3, and 4.
- When one polyp from the *Astrangia* comes out far enough to clip it, we will clip it, grind it up, and image it under the microscope.

# Day 1:
- Measurements at ~1 pm and Corals 1 and c1 were sacrificed to make tissue slurry.
- Used airbrush to make slurry (find the protocol/video [here](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral_Tissue_Removal_protocol/) and brought slurry in 1.5 mL tubes to engineering to pipette on slide. Used DI water while airbrushing instead of filtered seawater.
- MG used a longer exposure time under the microscope to get rid of the autofluorescence.
- *Astrangia* in incubator wasn't clipped because its polyps weren't out.

# Day 2:
- MG measured signal with laser probe in the morning.
- Corals 2, c2, 3, and c3 were sacrificed to make slurry at 3:30 (this time using seawater from c2, DI water is bad for this use!).
- Astrangia (coral 11) is in CBLS AQ room where a polyp can still be snipped.

# Possible problems


# Outcomes

On day 1 (24hrs post-exposure) under the microscope we found that the *Pocillopora* tissue did uptake CNTs!!

There did seem to be less autofluorescence.

# Next steps

DR suggested blasting a coral frag with the laser for 20 minutes to bleach the chlorophyll and minimize autofluorescence, to only look at CNTs. MG may try this Thursday (day 3).

HP suggested using *Aiptasia* larvae to study uptake without interference.

In the future we should take pictures of the corals throughout the experiment to show survival and health (appearance) when treated with NanoTubes. We could also do color scoring to quantitatively assess health.
