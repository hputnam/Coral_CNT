# Coral_CNT

# Coral CNT Trial 2 (20210803)

# Setup overview
### Experimental design
- Placed 6 SYMBIOTIC corals, 3 treatment and 3 control *Astrangia poculata*, into individual 100 mL glass jars with ~24 degress C .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater.  

### Exposure (Day 0)
- Added CNT lipid sensor at 5mg/L for Corals 5-7 at 3:30pm. Corals 8-10 were exposed to ~40 mL filtered seawater with no CNTs for 30 minutes and were kept as controls.
- Bring smaller containers for the 30 min. exposure; balance stress and using the least amount of CNT solution possible.
- Possibly use multiple exposures and measure a few hours later to keep the CNTs in the coral (possibly peak at 6 hrs).
- Also consider using a longer exposure time.
- Placed corals into the 25Â°C incubator.

### Measurements
- We followed and measured the same distinct polyps in this experiment. We should find a good way to normalize this (or could use multiple locations and average the signals for one organism).
- Sacrifice and image 1 coral's tissue a day on days 2, 3, and 4.

# Day 1:
- Use airbrush to make slurry (find the protocol/video [here](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral_Tissue_Removal_protocol/) and bring slurry tubes over and pipette on slide in engineering.
- Measurements at 1:15 pm and coral 5 was sacrificed to make tissue slurry.

# Day 2:
- Corals 6 and 9 were sacrificed to make slurry at 1:45, after signals were taken
- MG has data/figs

# Day 3:
- Measured signal with laser probe around 11:45
- Corals 7 and 10 were cut in half, and the halves with polyps 1-3 and 1 respectively were sacrificed to make tissue slurry at 12:30
- HP and AH came in to look at cells under scope

# Possible problems

We need HP to definitively spot coral cells under the microscope.

We might benefit from staining the tissue slurry.

We can't image the cells and get a spectra when they're moving.

# Outcomes

On day 2 (20210804) there was a strong signal from some NanoTubes in the tissue slurry from Coral 5 (MG has data).

MG overlaid the spectra and images (from trial 1 and corals 5 and 6 from trial 2) and found there was mostly autofluorescence not NanoTubes.

# Next steps

We could look at *Pocillopora* to see if the NanoTubes have entered the coral cells, since there would be less algae on the tissue like the *Astrangia* have.

OR we could go back to looking at aposymbiotic *Astrangia* in case the intracellular symbiotic algae hides the signal from NanoTubes.

We could look at heat stressed *Astrangia* to compare these to the results from Trial 1 and Trial 2.

I SHOULD clean *Astrangia* of algae next time to minimize algal autofluorescence!
