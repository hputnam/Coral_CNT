# Coral_CNT

# Coral CNT Controlled Experimet 1 (20210803)

# Setup overview
### Experimental design
- Clean Astrangia of algae to minimize algal autofluorescence!
- Placed 6 corals, 3 treatment and 3 control, (*Astrangia poculata*) into individual 100 ml glass jars with ~24 degress C .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater (company and info).  

### Exposure
- Added CNT lipid sensor at 5mg/L for Corals 5-7. Corals 8-10 were exposed to ____ solution with no CNTs for the same amount of time and were kept as controls.
- Bring smaller containers for the 30 min. exposure; balance stress and using the least amount of CNT solution possible.
- Possibly use multiple exposures and measure a few hours later to keep the CNTs in the coral (possibly peak at 6 hrs).
- Also consider using a longer exposure time.
- Placed corals into the 25Â°C incubator.

### Measurements
- Follow and measure the same distinct polyps in this experiment--find a good way to normalize this (or could use multiple locations and average the signals for one organism).
- Sacrifice and image 1 coral a day if there are enough to continue the trial.
- Use airbrush to make slurry and bring slurry tubes over and pipette on slide in engineering.
