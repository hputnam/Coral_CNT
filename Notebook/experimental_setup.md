# Coral CNT Experimental Setup

# Materials
- myTEMP Mini Digital Incubator
- ____ brand light (controlled with myAI app)
  - 8 am - 5 pm ramp
  - all light levels set to 10%
- n 100 mL glass jars with lids, ethanol and DI rinsed (n = number of corals in experiment)
- tape
- sharpie
- small square of plexiglass
- .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater
- large squirt bottle

### *Note on storage of supplies:*
All Putnam materials in engineering are stored in the drawer and cabinet to the right of the incubator! (Including sharpies, 2 tripours, extra jars, beakers, falcon tubes for water samples, and a pipette.)
All materials in CBLS used for the experiment are stored to the left of the black shelf next to the bench in the aquarium room. (Including an extra light/cord, extra box of jars, stir bars/rod, magnets, and the homemade stir plates.)

# Incubator setup
1. Program the light. (Make sure to measure it under water on the top and bottom shelf, with and without plexiglass depending on your experimental setup.)
2. Set the incubator temp. to 24°C for *Astrangia* (the water on the bottom shelf will actually be around 23.25°C at this setting). Or 27°C for *Pocillopora*.
3. Fill a squirt bottle with the filtered water for water changes (or put more water in another incubator set at the same temp as the coral water).
4. Place corals into individual 100 mL glass jars filled most of the way with .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater. (12 jars can fit on the bottom shelf of the incubator.)
5. Label all jars with a number, "live," and "CNT only."
6. Place the plexiglass rectangle on top of the jars, to cover the most area possible and prevent evaporation, without the taped sides blocking the light.
7. Ethanol, wipe out, and DI rinse any jars after throwing their corals out.

# Problems
When we used the glass bowls the temperature of the water on the top and bottom shelves of the incubator (first set at 27°C) were pretty different (~27 vs. 25.5 respectively).

Large incubator in engineering was set at 25°C but the water temp. was 28.2°C on 20210802 ... not sure why. Then it was set at 24°C while the water temp. was 26.52°C.

If we are experimenting with different species at the same time, we would probably have to use separate incubators to get ideal conditions.

# Future Improvements
We should take pictures of the corals throughout the experiment to show survival and health (appearance) when treated with NanoTubes. We could also do color scoring to quantitatively assess health.

Reviewers will like to see the water being stirred to mimic more natural ocean conditions, so we should put HP's stir plate invention in the incubator with stir bars. This also means we'll have to boost the corals above the stir bars somehow.

We could use rubber bands to hold plastic wrap over the jars to prevent evaporation, especially if the water is being stirred.

We should also do a 24 hour or longer water quality monitoring trial so we know how well the corals typically do in the experimental conditions.

For *Pocillopora*, we could possibly have frags glued to plastic plugs or flat aragonite discs so they don't fall by the stir bar. We would just have to make sure they're the least stressed possible and they can all fit well into a beaker so we can use the least amount of CNT solution possible during exposure.
