# Incubator setup

Placed 2 corals (*Astrangia poculata*) into individual 100 ml glass jars (dimensions) with .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater (company and info).  

27Â°C incubator

# Problems

When we used the glass bowls the temperature of the water on the top and bottom shelves of the incubator were pretty different (~27 vs. 25.5 respectively). But since using the smaller jars we can fit them all on one shelf, so it should be fine now. But just wanted to let you know in case that's a problem.

Large incubator in engineering is set at 24 degrees C but the water temp. was ___ on 20210802 ... not sure why. But I filed the small water bottle up with that water and put it ack in the sal incubator, so it will get back closer to 23 degrees C.
