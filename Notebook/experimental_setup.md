# Coral CNT Experimental Setup

# Materials
- myTEMP Mini Digital Incubator
- ____ brand light (controlled with myAI app)
  - 8 am - 5 pm ramp
  - all light levels set to 10%
- n 100 mL glass jars with lids, ethanol and DI rinsed (n = number of corals in experiment)
- tape
- sharpie
- small square of plexiglass
- .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater
- large squirt bottle

# Incubator setup
1. Program the light. (Make sure to measure it under water on the top and bottom shelf, with and without plexiglass depending on your experimental setup.)
2. Set the incubator temp. to 24°C for *Astrangia* (the water on the bottom shelf will actually be around 23.25°C at this setting). Or 27°C for *Pocillopora*.
3. Fill a squirt bottle with the filtered water for water changes (or put more water in another incubator set at the same temp as the coral water).
4. Place corals into individual 100 mL glass jars filled most of the way with .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater.  
5. Label all jars with a number, "live," and "CNT only."
6. 12 jars can fit on the bottom shelf of the incubator.
7. Ethanol, wipe out, and DI rinse any jars after throwing their corals out.
8. All Putnam materials in engineering are stored in the drawer and cabinet to the right of the incubator!

# Problems
When we used the glass bowls the temperature of the water on the top and bottom shelves of the incubator (first set at 27°C) were pretty different (~27 vs. 25.5 respectively).

Large incubator in engineering was set at 25°C but the water temp. was 28.2°C on 20210802 ... not sure why. Then it was set at 24°C while the water temp. was 26.52°C.
