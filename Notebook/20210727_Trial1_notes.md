# Coral_CNT

# Coral CNT Uptake Test 1 (20210727)

# Setup overview

Placed 2 corals (*Astrangia poculata*) into individual 100 mL glass jars (dimensions) with .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater (company and info).  

On 20210727 we added CNT lipid sensor at 1mg/L for Coral 1 and 5mg/L for Coral 2. Corals 3 and 4 received no CNTs and were kept as controls.

Placed corals into the 27Â°C incubator.

# Outcomes

We used 1mg/L and 5mg/L concentrations of nanotubes today on 2 corals, and both got a signal after 30 minutes! The 5mg/L was a lot stronger. We also have a reference background seawater signal.

We didn't see much with the inverted scope because the colony blocked a lot of light. We are planning to use a cell culture/tissue slurry in the next experiment to examine where the CNTs have gone.

We will extract the tissue from the corals and image it under the microscope 8 days post-exposure (20210804).

We will then throw the corals away :'(

The corals still had a slight signal 8 days post exposure, but when we made the tissue slurry 8 days post exposure and used the microscope, there were not very many visible nanotubes.

On 20210804 we returned Corals 3 and 4 and disposed of Corals 1 and 2.

# Possible problems

CNTs binding to possible extracellular mucus or bacterial films. (We can see if this is a problem using the tissue slurry and microscope in future trials.)

When we used the glass bowls the temperature of the water on the top and bottom shelves of the incubator were pretty different (~27 vs. 25.5 respectively). But since using the smaller jars we can fit them all on one shelf, so it should be fine now.

# Next steps

We'll also look at the signal tomorrow after 24 hours, and if there's a strong signal we'll keep testing the corals to see how long the CNTs stay.  

Mitch has the peak and microscope images from today.

Our plan for next week is to try exposing some small fragments of Pocillopora to compare signals and survivorship, and we could also start with the tissue slurry.
