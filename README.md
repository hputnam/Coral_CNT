# Coral CNT Uptake Test 1
20210727

Exposure protocol

Placed 2 corals (Astrangia poculata) into individual Xml glass chambers (dimensions) with artifical seawater (company and info).  

Added CNT lipid sensor at 1mg/L for one coral and 5mg/L for another coral.

Placed corals into the 27Â°C incubator




# Outcomes and Next Steps


When we used the glass bowls the temperature of the water on the top and bottom shelves of the incubator were pretty different (~27 vs. 25.5 respectively). But since using the smaller jars we can fit them all on one shelf, so it should be fine now. But just wanted to let you know in case that's a problem.
  
We used 1mg/L and 5mg/L concentrations of nanotubes today on 2 corals, and both got a signal after 30 minutes! The 5mg/L was a lot stronger. We also have a reference background seawater signal.
  
Like I said earlier we didn't see much with the inverted scope so we were going to ask you if/how I could bring a cell culture, but the tissue slurry you mentioned would work too!
  
Next steps:
We'll also look at the signal tomorrow after 24 hours, and if there's a strong signal we'll keep testing the corals to see how long the CNTs stay.  
Mitch has the peak and microscope images from today, and he'll be emailing them to you and Dan soon!  
Our plan for next week is to try exposing some small fragments of Pocillopora to compare signals and survivorship, and we could also start with the tissue slurry.  
One remaining barrier that you brought up is the possibility of the CNTs staying in a mucus or bacterial membrane, and we're not sure how to address that. But we may be able to tell where the CNTs are with the tissue slurry, so we can cross that bridge when we get to it.
