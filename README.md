# Coral_CNT

## Goals:
To examine the uptake and longevity of Carbon NanoTube (CNT) lipid sensors in coral colonies and cells

To compare the CNT lipid sensor to traditional lipid quantification methods

To quantify lipids in live corals under thermal stress

#### Steps:
Produce reliable data on the uptake and longevity of Carbon NanoTube (CNT) lipid sensors in Astrangia colonies and cells

Extract tissue to examine intracellular lipid content in Astrangia

Compare the uptake and longevity of Carbon NanoTube (CNT) lipid sensors in Pocillopora and Montipora coral colonies and cells

Compare the CNT lipid sensor to traditional lipid quantification methods

Test lipid content of bailing out polyp micropropagules through settlement process (Pocillopora is the most reliable for now)

Test Astrangia larvae through settlement process

Quantify lipids in live corals under thermal stress, and base a proposal on this

Test for possible toxicity of CNTs using micropropagules
