# Materials
- n coral frags/samples
- n ziplock bags
- n 1.5 mL tubes
- scissors
- gloves
- safety goggles
- airbrushing hose, pump, and gun (__ brand)
- .22 um PES membrane filtered seawater

# Protocol
1. After taking the signal with the probe in engineering, put the lids on the jars of n treatment corals and their corresponding control(s), and bring them to CBLS.
2. Get out the airbrushing hose, pump, and gun, and plug in the pump. Screw the hose and gun together and attach to the pump. Ethanol and/or DI rinse equipment if needed before use.
3. Fill the bottle with filtered seawater and attach it to the bottom of the gun.
4. Place one coral frag/sample in the first sterile plastic bag, about halfway in, and hold a small part of it between your fingers. (Do control corals first to minimize the possible CNT exposed tissue that could get on the airbrush and transfer to other samples.)
5. Turn the airbrush on and push down on the top lever to start blasting tissue off. Angle the gun so you blast the tissue down into the bag, and rotate the coral between your fingers to get clear shots of tissue.
6. When you have enough tissue slurry, take the airbrush out of the bag and seal it. Cut the corner from the bag and drain the slurry into a sterile 1.5 mL tube.
7. Image the cell slurry under the engineering microscope soon after airbrushing to optimize intact/alive cells. If a delay is necessary keep the slurry at the corals' ambient temperature, or keep them on ice.
8. The slurry can be thrown out after imaging and saving the data, because it does not last longer than a few weeks.

### Alternatives
1. Calcium magnesium free seawater would cause the coral tissue to sluff off and not damage the cells as much.
