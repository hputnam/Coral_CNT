# Tissue Slurry Airbrushing Protocol

# Materials
-
- gloves

# Protocol
1. After taking the signal with the probe in engineering, put the lids on the jars of n treatment corals and their corresponding control(s), and bring them to CBLS.
2. Get out the airbrushing hose ____
3.
4.
5.
6.
7. Image cell slurry under microscope soon after airbrushing to optimize intact/alive cells. If a delay is necessary keep the slurry at the corals' ambient temperature, or keep them on ice.
8. The slurry can be thrown out after imaging and saving the data, because it does not last longer than a few weeks.

### Alternatives
1. Calcium magnesium free seawater would cause the coral tissue to sluff off and not damage the cells as much.
