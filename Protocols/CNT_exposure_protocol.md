# Coral CNT Exposure Protocol

# Materials
- 2 100 mL beakers for *Astrangia*
- a well plate for *Pocillopora*
- Carbon NanoTubes solution combined with filtered seawater, usually 5 mg/L concentration
- gloves

# Protocol
1. Pick 3-6 recognizable polyps on each treatment *Astrangia* coral you're using, and 1 polyp on each control coral (not possible for *Pocillopora*). (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to take pictures of the polyps and label them by # so you can look at that for each subsequent measurement.)
2. Take a background signal of each polyp and save the graph with the coral and polyp number. Repeat this for each treatment and control coral.
3. Place all CNT treatment corals into one 100 mL beaker. Mix .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater with enough CNT solution to cover the treatment corals, at a 5 mg/L concentration, and add that to the beaker.
4. Place control corals into one 100 mL beaker, and cover with .22 um PES membrane filtered artificial seawater.
5. BE VERY CAREFUL not to cross contaminate the CNT exposed and non-CNT exposed corals; change gloves after touching CNT exposed corals or water.
6. Let both beakers of corals sit for 30 minutes (or longer for better signal?). Consider doing repeat exposures every 24 hours to maintain a strong signal, which DR says peaks at 6 hours post exposure.
7. Dispose of any water or materials that have touched the CNTs properly.
8. Rinse both control and treatment corals with filtered seawater over the waste container, to remove any exterior CNTs.
9. Place corals into individually labeled jars in the incubator.
