# Coral CNT Water Quality and Water Change Protocol

# Materials
- n 50 mL falcon tubes (n = number of corals)
- 2 tripours labeled waste and seawater
- sharpies
- lab notebook
- .22 um PES membrane filtered seawater (at same temp. as coral water)
- temperature probe
- pH probe
- salinity probe
- light probe
- DI water
- kimwipes

# Protocol
1. Read through these steps before starting just to make sure you don’t leave the corals exposed for too long.
2. Only use the seawater that comes from the filtered seawater in the container (carboy) to the right of the incubator on the lab bench. This water is the same as the bottle in the incubator, so you can also use that smaller bottle!
3. Open the incubator and carefully take out all the coral dishes. Take out the bottle of seawater; it has just been acclimating to the incubator’s temperature so it is not too cold and shocking for the corals (it comes directly from the bigger container).
4. One at a time for each coral, slowly and gently dump the container’s water into the tripour labeled “seawater only” if you’re doing water quality, or dump it into the tripour labeled “waste” if you’re not doing water quality. You can hold the coral against the container so it doesn’t fall out while you’re pouring.
5. Ideally within a few seconds of emptying the dish, pour water from the small bottle from the incubator into the dish as full as possible without spilling, and definitely enough to fully submerge the coral. (It’s especially important to fill the dish as much as possible before the weekend so the water doesn’t evaporate and leave the coral exposed.)
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for each coral, making sure to keep track of which ones you’ve changed and which you still have to do.
7. If you’re testing the water quality, after pouring one dish into the “seawater only” tripour, pour water from that into the corresponding labeled falcon tube in the rack, enough to fill the tube 2/3 of the way. Pour the extra water that doesn't fit in the falcon tube into the waste container.
8. Repeat step 7 for each dish to fill up the different water quality sample tubes, and bring them to CBLS to test water quality soon after they’re collected. OR, bring the probes (especially temp. and pH as these change quickest) to the corals. Rinse any probes in DI water.
9. If you’re not testing the water quality, dump the collected old water from the waste container down the sink.
10. Rinse in tap water from the sink any tripour you used.
11. Lastly, refill the small bottle from the incubator with the filtered seawater from the big carboy on the right. Make sure both containers are closed tightly, and put the small bottle back with the spout up so it doesn’t pour out in the incubator.
12. Put the coral dishes back in the incubator, cover them with the plexiglass to prevent evaporation, and close the incubator. Wipe up any water and if needed to get salt off, and wipe down with ethanol.

# Future considerations:
- A stir plate may be added, made of magnets and computer fans. Stir bars can go underneath corals on small pieces of egg crate/tube rack. This will move the water around and prevent films from forming over the corals.
- Air stones could be added to improve WQ.
