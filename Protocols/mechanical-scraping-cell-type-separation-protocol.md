# Mechanical dissociation and cell separation protocol

* author: Lauren Zane
* date updated: 20220727

## Materials
* labelled waste container
* liquid waste container for PBS
* 1000 uL pipette/tips
* 1.5mL Eppendorf tube (2 per coral microfragment)
* small sterile petri dishes (1 per coral microfragment)
* sterile forceps
* adult toothbrushes with soft bristles
* 1X room temperature PBS
* gloves
* toothbrush rinse cup filled with DI water
* 70% ethanol
* paper towels
* coral fragments 0.5cm-2cm long

## Full Protocol 

1. Using the 1000uL pipette to transfer 1mL of room temperature 1X PBS to small petri dish
2. using clean adult toothbrush, brush coral tissue into the petri dish with PBS,
  * notes: brush with the scrubbing force of brushing teeth, dip toothbrush bristles into petri dish and rinse with the 1X PBS to collect cells in the dish
3. collect tissue slurry using pipette, transfer to labelled 1.5mL Eppendorf tube
4. use Pasteur pipette to mix the solution and break up any large chunks of tissue
5. centrifuge at 100 rcf for 10 minutes to separate cells with symbionts from cells without symbionts
6. remove supernatant containing cells without symbionts and transfer to new Eppendorf tube
    * discard Eppendorf tube containing pellet with coral cells containing symbionts
7. after separating cells with symbionts from cells without symbionts, move onto other cell staining protocols, like the Trypan blue stain protocol or the Annexin V staining protocol
