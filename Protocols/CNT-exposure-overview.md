# Concentration and Timepoint Optimization Protocol
* author: Lauren Zane
* date: 20220713

### all materials

- sterile bone clippers
- labeled sterile forceps (CNT and LIVE)
- filtered, sterile artificial seawater (ASW)
- labeled Pasteur pipettes
  - ASW (CNT and LIVE)
  - "dirty" for tissue slurry (CNT and LIVE)
  - PBS (CNT and LIVE)
- 1000 uL pipette/tips
- 20uL pipette/tips
- gloves/labcoat
- paper towels
- glass coral jars
- one 12-well tissue culture plate per timepoint (coated or non coated)
- compound microscope
- two reptile egg incubators
- temperature probe
- bleaching score ruler
- white tub for bleaching score
- labeled 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes
- trypan blue stain
- 1X phospate buffered saline (PBS)
- hemocytometer *specifically for CNT project*

## preparation
1. label all Pasteur pipettes
2. make a platemap for 12-well plates
3. make datasheet in lab notebook for polyp extension scoring, Trypan blue staining, and estimated assay time
4. collect all materials and double check you have enough of everything to take to the Roxbury lab

## protocol overview

### live coral preparation and incubation

1. in CBLS aquarium, place coral colonies into glass jars with tank water and lightly close lid
2. in the Roxbury lab, use sterile bone cutters to make *P. acuta* microfragments 0.3-0.5cm in length and place 1 coral per well in labeled 12-well tissue culture plate
3 . rinse each microfragment twice with filtered, sterile artificial seawater and use the quantitative pipettes to fill well with ~2 mL filtered, sterile ASW or GL-6 solution at the desired concentration
4. place 12-well plates into benchtop incubators with the lid on, in the dark at 27Â°C, for the desired incubation time

### probe measurement

5. use probe to measure CNT concentration in all corals

### toxicity assays

6. score polyp extension according to Burmester *et al* 2021
7. use ring light to take bleaching score photos of all corals
8. PAM fluorescence
8. sacrifice microfragment for Trypan blue staining
