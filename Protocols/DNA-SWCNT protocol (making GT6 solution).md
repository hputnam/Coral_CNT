DNA-SWCNT protocol (making GT6 solution)

Needed Materials: 
Frozen (GT)15 DNA (or GT6, GT30, etc) 
Scale (Measuring CNT weight) 
2 x 1 mL vials 
HiPco CNT 
0.1 M NaCl Solution 
Ice block (Keep in freezer) 
 
Step-by-step Process: 
Complete calculations for DNA solution. 
DNA has weight, move decimal point two places to the right and add that many uL of 0.1 M NaCl solution to the DNA.  
If weight is 7.32 g then add 732 uL of NaCl solution. 
The final solution will have a concentration of 10 mg/mL. 
Thaw and add the calculated amount of 0.1 M NaCl solution from step 1 to the DNA. 
Complete calculations for CNT amount. 
HiPco CNT has a wt % for the CNT. 
Take the inverse of the decimal of the weight percent in order to get the proper amount of mg of HiPco to add. 
If weight % is 7.85 then do (1/0.0785) to get 12.74 mg of HiPco for final DNA-CNT solution. 
Final weight gives a total of 1 mg of CNTs. 
In a 1 mL vial add the proper amount of CNT from step 2. 
Add 200 uL of DNA to the 1 mL vial from step 3. 
Add 800 uL of 0.1 M NaCl to the same vial from step 3 and 4. 
This is the final solution of DNA-CNT with a total volume of 1 mL or 1000 uL 
Final ratio is 2 mg DNA : 1 mg CNTs 
Cut another 1 mL vial just below the first larger measuring line. 
Press fit this cut vial into the first vial to act as a splash guard for the sonicator. 
Grab the ice block from the freezer and set it up in the sonicator. 
Sonicate the DNA-CNT solution at 40% amplitude for 30 minutes.
