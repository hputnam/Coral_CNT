Considerations: 
Determine optimal power for project (can burn holes if leave sample under for too long) 
Constant laser height for project (record on the gradient)  
Want to be as close to sample as possible (just for the reading and then remove sample) 

Password for Computer:  "nanotube" 
Switch on "Spec", "cam", "laser" on poweer strip
Turn laser on: (On switch, turn dial to desired power (we used 0.99 for hyperspectral), Don't turn key on yet... don't want to burn out laser)  
Open Andor Solis program  
Drag cursor to 1200  
"File" -> "configure file" -> "load"  (Desktop -> Ander Calib File -> 15 Oct 2021 (the other date won't work) 
(range should be 1000 to 1400 – if not there is something wrong and the program needs to be reconfigured – DON'T SAVE) 
Key turn laser on (record power reading so can consistently use) 
Make sure to mark of triplicate sections to repeatedly image if doing over multiple time points... stamp (teal tool) 
"Acquisition" -> ("take background"  or ctrl + B)  
Load sample 
Click "camera"  
To save: "file" -> "Export As" (NEVER SAVE AS OR SAVE) 
ASCII XY (file type), settings: "signal", "tab" 
Safer to save to computer and not drive (export separately) bc faulty connection  
Exit: all "NO SAVE" (files and program)
