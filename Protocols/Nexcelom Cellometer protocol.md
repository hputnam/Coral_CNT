Nexcelom Cellometer protocol  

Staining Procedure  

1. Verify the concentration of the positive / negative controls and cell samples using the Vision CBA Analysis System.  

2. Use the Cellometer Sample Adjustment Calculator to generate a cell sample with a concentration between 2 and 3 million cells per mL (2-3 x 10^6 cells/mL). See section 5.0: Using the Sample Adjustment Calculator.  

3. Into a new tube, pipette 50 µl of cells that are at a concentration of 2-3 x 10^6 cells/mL. Spin down cell sample at 200 - 400 x g (~1,000 to 2,000 rpm) for 5 minutes, aspirate medium, then re- suspend cells in 40 µl of Annexin V Binding Buffer (Nexcelom Part# CS0-0115-100ML). Mix by pipetting up and down at least 10 times. (aka 1.5*10^5 total cells in 50 uL of 3*10^6  cells/mL)  

4. Add 5 µl of Annexin V-FITC (Nexcelom Part# CS1-0114) 

5. Add 5 µl of PI solution (Nexcelom Part# CS1-0116). 

6. Gently pipette the cells up and down ten times, then incubate for 15 min at RT (25°C) in the dark.  

7. Add 250 µl of 1x PBS to the sample and spin down the cell sample at 200 - 400 x g (~1,000 to 2,000 rpm) for 5 minutes. 

 8. Carefully aspirate off the medium and re-suspend cell pellet in 50 µl of Annexin V Binding Buffer (Nexcelom Part# CS0-0115-100ML). Mix by pipetting up and down ten time
