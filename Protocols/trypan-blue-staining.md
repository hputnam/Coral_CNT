# Trypan blue staining protocol
* author: Lauren Zane
* date updated: 20220713

## Materials
* labelled waste container
* liquid waste container for PBS
* 20 uL pipette/tips
* 1000 uL pipette/tips
* glass Pastuer pipettes/bulbs (one for 1X PBS only, other "slurry" for tissue slurry, different sets for CNT and LIVE corals)
* 1.5mL Eppendorf tube (2 per coral microfragment)
* small sterile petri dishes (1 per coral microfragment)
* sterile forceps
* adult toothbrushes
* 1X room temperature PBS
* Trypan blue stain (mutagen!)
* lab coat/gloves
* toothbrush rinse cup filled with DI water
* 70% ethanol
* paper towels
* hemocytometer (specifically for CNT and trypan blue staining)
* cover slips

## protocol
1. using the "PBS" Pasteur pipette, transfer ~1mL room temperature 1X PBS to small petri dish
2. using clean adult toothbrush, brush coral tissue into a petri dish with PBS
  * notes: brush with the scrubbing force of brushing teeth, dip toothbrush bristles into petri dish and rinse with the 1X PBS to collect cells in the dish
3. collect tissue slurry using "slurry" Pasteur pipette, deposit in 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes
4. use Pasteur pipette to mix the solution and break up large chunks of tissue
5. centrifuge at 500 rcf for 3 minutes
6. use slurry Pasteur pipette, remove supernatant
7. resuspend cells in 1mL PBS using 1000uL pipette
  * notes: it is necessary to take all precautions to remove seawater as seawater can react with the Trypan blue stain
8. transfer 100uL of slurry to a clean 1.5mL Eppendorf tube using 250uL pipette
9. *carefully* add 10uL Trypan blue to the 100uL slurry and mix thoroughly
10. transfer stained cell suspension to hemocytometer using a glass transfer pipette
11. count and record the total number of coral cells and number that stain blue
12. clean slide with a Kimwipe and EtOH into specific trypan blue solids waste container
13. rinse toothbrush in 90% ethanol, and then 100% DI water 2x and then in 1X PBS and leave to dry between samples
